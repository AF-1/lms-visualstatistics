Visual Statistics
====

With **Visual Statistics**[^1] you can display statistics of your LMS music library using all kinds of charts. Hovering over segments, bars or data points will display more information. The <b>bars</b> in many <i>bar charts</i> are <b>clickable</b> and will take you directly to the <b>browse menu</b> of the <i>artist, album, genre or year</i>.<br>

If you're interested in lists with tracks, albums or artists sorted by statistics for a specific artist, album, genre, year/decade or playlist, have a look at the [**Context Stats**](https://github.com/AF-1/lms-contextstats#context-stats) plugin.<br><br><br>

Go to *Home Menu* > *Extras* > *Visual Statistics*
<br><br>
While the charts scale down, please note that this plugin was designed for wide/big screens.
<br><br>
If you have the [**Alternative Play Count**](https://github.com/AF-1/lms-alternativeplaycount) plugin installed, you will see some additional charts that use the data from this plugin.

## Installation

You should be able to install *Visual Statistics* from *LMS* > *Settings* > *Plugins*.<br>

If you want to test a new patch that hasn't made it into a release version yet, you'll have to [install the plugin manually](https://github.com/AF-1/sobras/wiki/Manual-installation-of-LMS-plugins).

It usually takes a few hours for a *new* release to be listed on the LMS plugin page.
