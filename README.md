Visual Statistics
====

A plugin for [Logitech Media Server](https://github.com/Logitech/slimserver)<br>

<br>
Displays statistics of your LMS music library using all kinds of charts. Hovering over segments, bars, or data points will display more information.<br>

Go to *Home Menu* > *Extras* > *Visual Statistics*
<br><br>
While the charts scale down please note that this plugin was designed for wide/big screens.
<br><br><br>


## Installation

You should be able to install *Visual Statistics* from *LMS* > *Settings* > *Plugins*.<br>

If you want to test a new patch that hasn't made it into a release version yet or you need to install a previous version you'll have to [install the plugin manually](https://github.com/AF-1/sobras/wiki/Manual-installation-of-LMS-plugins).

*Previously released* versions are available here for a *limited* time after the release of a new version. The official LMS plugins page is updated about twice a day so it usually takes a couple of hours before new released versions are listed.

## Translation
The [**strings.txt**](https://github.com/AF-1/lms-visualstatistics/blob/main/VisualStatistics/strings.txt) file contains all localizable strings. Once you're done testing the plugin with your translated strings just create a pull request on GitHub. If that doesn't work for you post the updated file as an attachment in the [forum](https://forums.slimdevices.com/showthread.php?114967-Announce-Visual-Statistics).<br><br>
It's probably not a bad idea to keep the translated sentences roughly as long as the original ones and to avoid special characters.
