With **Visual Statistics**[^1] you can display statistics of your LMS music library using all kinds of charts. Hovering over segments, bars or data points will display more information.<br>

If you're interested in lists with tracks, albums or artists sorted by statistics for a specific artist, album, genre, year/decade or playlist, have a look at the [**Context Stats**](https://github.com/AF-1/#-context-stats) plugin.<br>

> [!TIP]
> You can find the menus / GUI here: `Home Menu > Extras > Visual Statistics`

<br>
While the charts scale down, please note that this plugin was designed for wide/big screens.
<br><br>
If you have the [**Alternative Play Count**](https://github.com/AF-1/#-alternative-play-count) plugin installed, you will see some additional charts that use the data from this plugin.
